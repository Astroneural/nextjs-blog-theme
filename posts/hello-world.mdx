So it seems I finally figured out how to do something. Impressive. I mean, what is a .mdx file anyways? Also do people normally use Github has a text editor? I could see why, as that's what I'm doing. Anywho, this is really my first website, which is strange because it's entirely in JS and CSS apparently, but it's a template. Anyway I don't know JS or CSS, and there isn't a singly byte of HTML in here. 

I have another website also ripped off a template [here](www.shaum.ml).
